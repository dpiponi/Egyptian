# Egyptian
Some materials for studying Ancient Egyptian

The "source" is in `complete2.txt` and it builds `complete2.pdf`. As I don't remember where to get all of the needed tools to build the PDF I have provided a copy of the PDF as well.

Among these are:
1. `sesh` which IIRC preprocesses TeX files to conert transliterated egyptian to TeX commands. I don't know where to find this, I just have a binary.
2. `HieroTeX` available on [github](https://github.com/hierotex/hierotex)
