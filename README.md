Some materials for studying Ancient Egyptian

The "source" is in `complete2.txt` and it builds `complete2.pdf`. You'll need to edit `build3` as it's currently hard-coded to my local filesystem. But you can just use the PDF directly if you want.

You'll need to install `HieroTeX` which is available on [github](https://github.com/hierotex/hierotex).
As well as the TeX-based tools you'll need to build `sesh`.
