# Egyptian
Some materials for studying Ancient Egyptian

You can use `complete2.pdf`.

It is built from `complete.txt` but that relies on some tools you need to acquire from elsewhere.
I don't remember where I got them all from but if I rediscover I'll make note here.

Among these are:
1. `sesh` which IIRC preprocesses TeX files to conert transliterated egyptian to TeX commands.
2. `HieroTeX` available on [githib](https://github.com/hierotex/hierotex)
